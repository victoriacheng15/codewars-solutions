/* 
In this Kata, you will be given two strings a and b and your task will be to return the characters that are not common in the two strings.

For example:

solve("xyab","xzca") = "ybzc" 
--The first string has 'yb' which is not in the second string. 
--The second string has 'zc' which is not in the first string. 
Notice also that you return the characters from the first string concatenated with those from the second string.
*/

  const str1 = [...a].filter((char) => ![...b].includes(char)).join('');
  const str2 = [...b].filter((char) => ![...a].includes(char)).join('');
  return str1 + str2;
}
