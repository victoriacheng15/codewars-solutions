# codewars - **Working In Process**

A colletion of kata problems and my solutions. 

## How It's Made:

All problems are solved by using Javascript

The process:
- If it is the first time solution, use `add first solution` commit
- If the solution is changed, use `add updated solution` commit

#### Optimizations 

I would like to go back to completed problems again to see how to improve codes readability. 

## Lessons Learned:

TBA
