# codewars - **Working In Process**

A colletion of kata problems and my solutions. 

## How It's Made:

All problems are solved with JavaScript.

The process:
- If it is the first time solution, use `add first solution` commit
- If the solution is changed, use `add updated solution` commit

### General format

```js
/* 
Problem statement
*/

/* 
PREP:
- so on
*/

function something() {
  // do something
}
```

#### Optimizations 

I would like to go back to completed problems again to see how to improve codes readability. 

## Lessons Learned:
