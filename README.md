# codewars

A colletion of kata problems and my solutions. 

Here is [my profile on codewars](https://www.codewars.com/users/victoriacheng15)

> Note: It is highly recommedation that you completed it yourself before look solutions

## How It's Made:

All problems are solved with JavaScript.

The process:
- If it is the first time solution, use `add first solution` commit
- If the solution is changed, use `add updated solution` commit
- If the Jest test case was added, use `update solution with jest` commit

### General format

```js
/* 
Problem statement
*/

/* 
PREP:
- so on
*/

function something() {
  return 'something'
}

// Jest test
describe('test case', () => {
  it('should return the index of needle', () => {
    expect(something()).toMatch('something');
  });
});
```

#### Optimizations 

I would like to go back to completed problems again to see how to improve codes readability. 

## Lessons Learned:

I have been doing codewars daily for a couple of months. It is amazing to see different solutions for the same problem. The learning is endless. Keep doing it daily to allow me get familar with JavaScript functions and learn new ways to solve certain problems.
