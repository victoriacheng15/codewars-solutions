/* 
What if we need the length of the words separated by a space to be added at the end of that same word and have it returned as an array?

addLength('apple ban') => ["apple 5", "ban 3"]
addLength('you will win') => ["you 3", "will 4", "win 3"]
Your task is to write a function that takes a String and returns an Array/list with the length of each word added to each element .

Note: String will have at least one element; words will always be separated by a space.

/* 
PREP：
- input is string
- split the parameter into array
- get the legnth of the string
- add number with the string with space
- output is array

  const array = str.split(' ');
  return array.map((word) => `${word} ${word.length}`);
