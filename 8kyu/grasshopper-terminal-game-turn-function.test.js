/* 
Terminal game turn function
You are creating a text-based terminal version of your favorite board game. In the board game, each turn has six steps that must happen in this order: roll the dice, move, combat, get coins, buy more health, and print status.

You are using a library (Game.Logic in C#) that already has the functions below. Create a function named doTurn/DoTurn/do_turn that calls the functions in the proper order as described in the paragraph above.

- combat
- buyHealth
- getCoins
- printStatus
- rollDice
- move
*/
const rollDice = () => 'rollDice';
const move = () => 'move';
const combat = () => 'combat';
const getCoins = () => 'getCoins';
const buyHealth = () => 'buyHealth';
const printStatus = () => 'printStatus';

function doTurn() {
  [rollDice, move, combat, getCoins, buyHealth, printStatus].forEach((x) =>
    x()
  );
}

describe('turn', () => {
  it('should return buyHealth()', () => {
    expect(1 + 1).toBe(2);
  });
});
