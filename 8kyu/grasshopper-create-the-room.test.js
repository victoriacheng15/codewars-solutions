/* 
Escape the room
You are creating an "Escape the room" game. The first step is to create a hash table called rooms that contains all of the rooms of the game. There should be at least 3 rooms inside it, each being a hash table with at least three properties (e.g. name, description, completed).

    name: 'room1',
    description: 'This is the first room.',

    description: 'This is the second room.',
    completed: true,

  room3: {
    name: 'room3',
    description: 'This is the third room.',
    completed: true,
