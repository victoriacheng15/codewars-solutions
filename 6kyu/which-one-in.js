/* 
Given two arrays of strings a1 and a2 return a sorted array r in lexicographical order of the strings of a1 which are substrings of strings of a2.

Example 1:
a1 = ["arp", "live", "strong"]

a2 = ["lively", "alive", "harp", "sharp", "armstrong"]

returns ["arp", "live", "strong"]

Example 2:
a1 = ["tarp", "mice", "bull"]

a2 = ["lively", "alive", "harp", "sharp", "armstrong"]

returns []

Notes:
Arrays are written in "general" notation. See "Your Test Cases" for examples in your language.
In Shell bash a1 and a2 are strings. The return is a string where words are separated by commas.
Beware: r must be without duplicates.

/* 
PREP:
- join array2 with space
- use filter to get ride of words are not included in array1 with search()

note:
search() - it takes regex as parameter
